    <h2>Samsa Recipe</h2>
    <p>This samsa (somsa) recipe is super delicious and is very similar to samsas made in the clay oven. 
        Except you will be baking them in your regular oven. 
        The dough is tender and very flaky. The taste is divine, because we will be using either ghee or clarified butter to create tender layers. 
        Let me introduce you to a new way of making uzbek samsa with this samsa recipe.</p>

    <p>You can interpret samsa as small meat pies. I’ve made these to our friends and family. They all equally enjoy samsa. This recipe will require knowing basic dough work and rolling. You will find detailed photos and explanations to go with each step. 
        Hopefully it will not be hard to understand and follow along. The good news is, this is more or less a lazy way of making this deliciousness. 
        Come along for the ride!</p>
